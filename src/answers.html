            <h1>Accessibility issues in 'Return a leaky bag of flour'</h1>
            <p>Here is the answer sheet for the 'Return a leaky bag of flour' accessibility testing exercise. There are 16 issues in total.</p>
            <h2>1. Contact us page</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Images are described if needed</h3>
            <p>Overly descriptive or repeated content is very frustrating for people using screen readers.  Leaving the alt tag out altogeher means the full filename is read out instead.</p>
            <h4>Issues</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask our social media team alt text too descriptive.</li>
                <li>Contact us using our online form link text and alt text are the same.</li>
                <li>Find store details and opening times has no alt text.</li>

            <h3>1.2 Links & buttons are descriptive</h3>
            <p>Click here, read more and learn more are often used for link text. Context is lost when people tab through a page or our zoomed into the content. Having descriptive text also gives the user ????</p>

            <p>Images of text don’t scale well and can become blurry when zoomed in. Text can often become to small to read when scaled down to a mobile screen. And page translator cannot translate image text.  </p>

            <h3>2.1 Lines lengths aren't too long or too short: 45–75 characters per line is acceptable</h3>
            <p>If a casual reader gets tired of reading a long horizontal line, then they’re more likely to skim the left edge of the text. If an engaged reader gets tired of reading a long horizontal line, then they’re more likely to accidentally read the same line of text twice (a phenomenon known as “doubling”).</p>

            <h3>2.2 Combination of colours shapes and text</h3>
            <p>Color plays an important part in a design. Colors evoke emotions, feelings, and ideas. Colors can also help strengthen a brand’s message and perception. Yet the power of colors is lost when a user can’t see them or perceives them differently. Color blindness affects roughly 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Focus states are clearly visible</h3>
            <p>Many people exclusively use keyboards to navigate, and rely on the focus state to know where they are on the page. If the focus state isn't visible (or hard to see), it's like trying to use a website with an invisible mouse cursor:</p>

            <h3>3.3 Tab order makes sense</h3>
            <p>Maria has tendonitis and is unable to use a mouse; instead, she uses the keyboard to navigate the web. When focus jumps randomly around the page she gets confused.</p>

            <h2>5. Thank you</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Align text to the left and keep a consistent layout</h3>
            <p>Left aligned text is easier to read than centered text for paragraphs. This is because when you center your text, the starting place of each line changes. This forces your users to work harder to find where each line begins to continue reading.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Animations can be stopped and aren't continuous</h3>
            <p>Animated images can really enhance user experience and understanding, but there are limitations. If they're not designed in an accessible way, GIFs can be distracting or could even cause seizures.</p>
