            <h1>Accessibility issues in 'Return a leaky bag of flour'</h1>
            <p>Here is the answer sheet for the 'Return a leaky bag of flour' accessibility testing exercise. There are XX issues in total.</p>
            <p>Some of these issues would not be WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 failures. But, they could present issues to users with access needs, and WCAG compliance doesn't neccessarily mean that something is accessible.</p>
