            <h1>Return a leaky bag of flour accessibility exercise</h1>
            <p>'Return a leaky bag of flour' is a made-up Co-op journey, filled with accessibility issues. Your task is to find them all!</p>
            <p>To help find the issues, you will need to download the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE accessibility plugin</a> on Chrome.</p>
            <p>For the exercise weâ€™ll be using just the keyboard and zooming in by 400%. This helps to experience issues that people face.</p>
            <p>We'll use <a href="/keyboard-navigation.html">this demo page</a> to show you how to navigate web pages with your keyboard.</p>
            <h2>There are 4 pages in total:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact us</li>
                <li>Product returns</li>
                <li>Product returns eligibility check</li>
                <li>Thank you</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="coop-u-margin-t-32">Accessibility issues start on the next page. Good luck!</p>
